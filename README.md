# Testing Android API 31
This app and repository are created for the course CT60A4160 Fundamentals of Software Testing of LUT University, Finland. 
The app takes in user-entered data and uses a SQLite database to store the data. 
The user can view, update, and delete the data later.

## Environment
The app was tested on API level 32 during development, using USB debugging.

## How does it work?
The user enters their name, email, and degree program for insertion. After the first insertion, the data can be viewed.
To update the data, the user needs to enter the new details and the ID of the data that needs to be changed.
To delete the dat, the user only needs to enter the ID of the data that needs to be deleted.
These functions are performed using SQLite query.
